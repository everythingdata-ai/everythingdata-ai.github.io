Hello and welcome to my blog for my learning journey !

My name is Mourad and as a Software Engineer, specialized in Data Engineering.

With an engineering degree balanced between IT and statistics, adapted to the challenges of storing, analyzing, visualizing big data and enhancing it; and 8 years of professional experience under my belt, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects that have challenged me to think creatively and strategically to develop robust data solutions. 

But as a perpetually curious person, the learning never stops. I'm always learning new things, whether it's exploring the latest developments in stream processing, experimenting with modern data stack tools, or learning about machine learning operations. 
But without practice, the knowledge starts slipping away, and trying to retrieve a specific piece of information feels like finding a needle in a haystack.
That's why I decided to start this blog, to document my learning journey, and have an online notebook that I can go back to whenever I need to remember something I learned.

## Main topics

Here, you'll find detailed technical tutorials, practical insights from real-world projects, and my thoughts on emerging trends in data engineering. Whether you're a fellow data professional or someone starting their journey in the field, I hope my notes and experiences can help make your learning path a little smoother.

Join me as I explore, learn, and share discoveries from the ever-evolving world of :

- Data Engineering
- AI / Machine Learning
- Cloud Computing
- Programming
