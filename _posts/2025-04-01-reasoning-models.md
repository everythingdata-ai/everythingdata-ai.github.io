title: Build reasoning models with Open R1

These are my notes from the Hugging Face [Reasoning Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter12/1). 
It's part of the NLP course, which focuses on fine-tuning models for reasoning abilities.


### Introduction 

This course is designed to help students understand reinforcement learning and its role in LLMs.
The main focus of the course is using [Open R1](https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1), a fully open reproduction of DeepSeek-R1.
Open R1 aims to make LLMs reason on complex problems. It does this by using reinforcement learning to encourage LLMs to ‘think’ and reason.
It  generates thoughts as well as outputs, and they can be handled separately.
