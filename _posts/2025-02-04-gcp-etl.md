- Automating workflows like data parsing, basic ETL, or notification systems triggered by events.
  
### Cloud Run
If the processing requires more resources than Cloud Run Functions (e.g., more complex processing or specific libraries), Cloud Run can be used to deploy containerized applications in a fully managed environment. 
Cloud Run has a great free-tier, with the first 180,000 vCPU-seconds/month // First 360,000 GiB-seconds/month // 2 million requests/month free or charge.

#### Key Features:
- Containerized: Runs Docker containers, which means you can include any dependencies or software in your container image.
- Scalable and flexible: Automatically scales based on the incoming workload, but you can control how much CPU and memory each container receives.
- Event-driven: Can trigger based on events such as an uploaded file to Cloud Storage or a message from Cloud Pub/Sub.
- Pay only for usage: You only pay for the resources consumed during the execution.
- Advanced use cases: Great for tasks like data analysis with custom libraries, data transformation, or running complex algorithms.
 
#### Use when:
- You need to run containerized applications that require more computing resources than Cloud Functions can handle.
- You want custom libraries or specific frameworks that are not supported by Cloud Functions.
- Your processing tasks are more complex and require flexibility in resource allocation (CPU, memory).

#### Ideal for:
- Larger-scale processing tasks where data is containerized, like running Python scripts with specific libraries for machine learning or data analysis.
- Projects that need to scale dynamically based on the number of incoming files or data events.

### Dataflow (Apache Beam)
Dataflow is a fully managed service for processing and analyzing large datasets, designed for real-time stream processing and batch processing. It's based on Apache Beam, which provides a unified programming model for both batch and stream processing.
