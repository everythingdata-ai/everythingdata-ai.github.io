Today's post won't be technical.
I have been job hunting for a couple of months now, and I wanted to share my experience.

I applied to 100+ jobs in the last month, but all I needed was one !

Ever since I started my professional career as a software engineer in 2016, I have been spoiled by attention from recruiters. I got comfortable, thinking it will always be that way.
However in 2024, for the first time, I struggled to find a job.

Here are, in my opinion, some of the reasons why, and what I learned from it : 

### Timing is everything : 

I spent most of December, every single day, applying for jobs online. The result ? One interview that went rather well (considering it as my first one in ages) but didn't materialize into an offer.

Then all of a sudden, everything changed on the week of January 13th. From Monday to Friday that week, my phone didn't stop ringing, and my LinkedIn inbox was flooded with messages. I had many recruiting processes going on, and after a month a despair, I could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Right after my last interview on Friday, as I was wrapping up for the week, I got a phone call from a recruiter, followed immediately by a technical interview with the team, and a few minutes after that, my first job offer ! I couldn't believe how fast it went after a whole month of no results that made me doubt my career choices.

So if you're struggling to find a job in the current market, maybe it's not you, sometimes it's just the timing. Holidays, budget planning and other factors can influence the recruiting activity.

### The market is flooded with unprepared candidates : 

This is not to insult anyone in any way, but I got many echos from recruiters that there is no shortage of IT and Data jobs, but rather a shortage of _qualified_ candidates.

This makes sense. Since I graduated in 2016, all I could hear is how Data Science (and more recently, Data engineering) is the "sexiest job in the world." This brought a mass of, obviously highly motivated individuals, but with no real experience in a field that is not very Entry-level friendly. 

There are countless bootcamps promising absolute beginners to find six-figure jobs in six months (I even thought about starting my own, but reconsidered since then.) While this might have worked 5 years ago, the market is now too saturated for that.

Also, LinkedIn made it so simple to apply that most candidates just click the Easy Apply button without making sure they fit the requirements first, almost every single job posting I saw had over 100 applicants despite being just posted. If you’re job hunting on LinkedIn, prioritize searching for actual posts by recruiters, and connect with them rather than applying through the LinkedIn Job tab. 

If you're new to the field, try to get as much experience as possible. You don't have to start your career in Data, you can start as a data analyst or an app developer, and make your way to Data Science/Engineering.

And if you're experienced, you should find ways to stand out, but also accept that your resume might get lost in a sea of candidates. Don't let that discourage you, because sooner or later, it will be noticed, and when that happens, you need to be ready to demonstrate how your experience speaks for itself. 


### The field is evolving fast :

During my first job, all I needed was basic scripting and database skills to set-up my first Business Intelligence pipelines.

In my last three roles, I worked with the same technical stack and got too comfortable in a niche of data tools. During that time, the Data Engineering scene was continuously changing, and the industry shifted to new tools that I'm not familiar with. 

While most Data professionals would agree that having an agnostic understanding of Data Engineering is more important than mastering a specific tool (I have never seen a certified GCP Data Engineer struggle to use Microsoft Azure, or a MySQL expert finding PostgreSQL hard to use), recruiters seem to think otherwise. If your resume doesn't mention the new shiny tool that is on the job posting, it will simply be discarded

So it's important to keep up the trends, even if just at a surface level, and to never stop learning. I know a few Data Engineers who only worked on on-premise projects, that are struggling to land Cloud based projects, even though doing things on the cloud is arguably easier. 


### Get your basics straight

I've missed out on a great opportunity by failing a coding test.

After a promising phone call with a recruiter, I thought I had found the perfect job. The exchange went well, and the scope of the project was a great fit for my experience. However, between me and my "dream job", stood a coding test. 

Having been out of work for a while, my Python skills were a bit rusty, but I decided to do the test (my first coding test ever) without prior preparation. Needless to say, I didn't do well. A few days later, as I was expecting, I got an e-mail stating that they won't be moving forward with my application (their loss.)

I personally think that coding tests are silly, I always refused to do them (until despair lead me to accept this one), and for a good reason : I find it hard to understand how being able to create a function to reverse ASCII art into a letter (that was an actual question from the test) can be a good indicator of how good a data engineer is. But despite that, I can't justify not being able to write good code.

If you're looking for good resources to brush up on your basics and refine you data skills, I recommend checking out Benjamin Dubreu (French content) or Zach Wilson (English content).

### I can't rely on a job

Last but not least, these tough times made me realise something import : I have no idea how to make money, outside of selling my time to companies. This is not a great place to be.

Relying on a company to make an income, especially in an unstable job market, can be risky.

This was a wake-up call for me to learn entrepreneurship, and develop skills to create my own income streams. 

### Conclusion 

Job hunting in today’s market isn’t easy, and while it can be discouraging at times, it's an opportunity to reflect, adapt, and grow until you find that one single opportunity that can change everything.

If you're going through a job hunt at the moment, hang in there, and may the force be with you !
