title: Taking Claude Code for a test drive
categories: [AI]
---

Today Anthropic announced their newest model, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and along with, Claude Code, an agentic coding tool.
Anthropic has identified that Coding is their biggest strength, and have now released an agentic coding system that you can use right now.
This is huge, guys. Not only is Sonnet 3.7 significantly better at coding, but Claude Code addresses most of the major pain points related to using LLMs while coding (understanding codebase context, quickly making changes, focusing on key snippets rather than writing entire files.. etc.).
Basically, the entire coding process just got a whole lot easier, a whole lot faster, and a lot more accessible.

Let's take it for a test run.

You can install Claude Code and launch it using these commands : 

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
cd your-project-directory
claude
```

You can then press Enter to login in.
Claude Code uses Anthopic's API, so you need to buy credits to use it.
I will buy 5$ to see how long it lasts.
