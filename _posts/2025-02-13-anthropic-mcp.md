title: A deep dive into Anthropic's Model Control Protocol
categories: [AI]
---

Anthropic just announced thei new model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, as well as Claud Code, their first agentic coding tool.
While these anouncements made the rounds, one anouncement went unnoticed : open-sourcing the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
But what is MCP, you ask ? The Model Context Protocol was created by Anthropic to standardize how applications provide context to LLMs.
Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

Following this protocol will make building AI agents so much easier.
Same as npm/pip libraries, there are now [MCP libraries](www.opentools.com) : someone wrote the code for a tool, you can integrate it with just one command.

MCP significantly enhances AI agentsâ€™ capabilities by enabling direct, bidirectional communication with external systems/data sources, which makes AI applications more interactive and aware of their surroundings.

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers.
Key components include:
- Host : An AI app (Claude desktop, Cursor) that provides an environment for AI interactions, accesses tools and data, and runs the MCP Client.
- Client : Operates within the host to enable communication with MCP servers.
- Server : A server exposes specific capabilities and provides access to data.

MCP has 3 key capabilities:

- Tools: Enable LLMs to perform actions through your server
- Resources: Expose data and content from your servers to LLMs
- Prompts: Create reusable prompt templates and workflows
