MS Fabric is based on the Delta Lake architecture.
This being a new concept for me, I decided to give deeper into the Lake architecture and principles.

## 1 - Introduction : Data Lake vs Delta Lake

While you don't need to work directly with Delta Lake APIs in order to use tables in a Fabric lakehouse, an understanding of the Delta Lake metastore architecture and familiarity with some of the more specialized Delta table operations can greatly expand your ability to build advanced analytics solutions on Microsoft Fabric.
But before we get into that, let's first something out of the way : what's the difference between a Data Lake and a Delta Lake ?
